.SH NAME
simple_shell - a simple command line interpreter, inspired by the UNIX shell.

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B shell

.SH DESCRIPTION
simple_shell is a simplified command line interpreter that displays a prompt, 
waits for the user to type a command, reads it and executes it if it exists in the system.
To execute the command, the shell looks for them in the PATH environment. 
If found, the command is executed in a child process, waits for it to finish and then displays a new prompt.
The shell loops until the user exits or an end-of-file (EOF) is reached.

.SH INVOCATION
The shell is started by executing the shell executable file.
When starts properly, it displays a '$' and waits for the user input.

.SH BUILTINS
.TP
.B exit

.SH ENVIRONMENT

.PP
Exit the shell:
