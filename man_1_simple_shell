NAME
		hsh - Simple UNIX command line interpreter

SYNOPSIS
		hsh [command [arg...]]

DESCRIPTION
		hsh is a simple UNIX command line interpreter that reads commands from
		the standard input and executes them. It supports both interactive and
		non-interactive modes.

		In interactive mode, hsh displays a prompt "$ " and reads commands
		until EOF (Ctrl+D) or the "exit" builtin command is executed.

		In non-interactive mode, hsh reads and executes a single command from
		standard input and exits.

BUILTIN COMMANDS
		exit   Exit the shell.

		env    Display all environment variables.

EXAMPLES
		Interactive mode:
			$ ./hsh
			$ ls -la
			$ env
			$ exit

		Non-interactive mode:
			echo "ls -la" | ./hsh

		Script execution:
			./hsh < script.sh

ERRORS
		hsh: command not found
			The specified command was not found in the directories listed in
			the PATH environment variable.

ENVIRONMENT
		PATH   Colon-separated list of directories to search for commands.
			Default: /usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin

		Any environment variables passed to hsh are preserved and available
		to executed commands via execve(2).

FILES
		None

RETURN VALUES
		hsh exits with 0 on success, 1 on error.

BUGS
		Does not support command chaining (&&, ||, ;).
		No variable expansion ($VAR).
		No history or tab completion.
		Limited error handling for memory allocation failures.

SEE ALSO
		sh(1), bash(1), execve(2), fork(2), wait(2), getenv(3)
